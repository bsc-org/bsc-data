Please Review!\n\nAfter the update, please review (and correct if necessary) the following settings:\n\n- Inverter → General → Battery pack settings → Capacity\n- Relay outputs → Invert\n- Data device mapping → Interface\n- Data device mapping → Address\n\n⚠️ Important: For this release, the display must be updated to version ≥ 1.0.5 — otherwise readings/values shown will be incorrect.\n\n# Firmware Mapping\n\n- Original BSC hardware: `firmware_xx_xx.bin`\n- Lilygo T-CONNECT – Flashing via USB: `firmware_tconnect_full_xx_xx.bin`\n- Lilygo T-CONNECT – Update via OTA: `firmware_tconnect_ota_xx_xx.bin`"
